# ADTs and Lists Tutorial

![Approved for: Spring 2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Spring%202024-blue)

## Introduction

An **Abstract Data Type** (ADT) is a high-level (abstract) description of a data type which includes the operations (methods)
available on the data type as well as what users of the data type should expect when using those operations. 
The exact implementation details, including the underlying structure, are left to the programmer. 
There are often many useful implementations for a given ADT. The decision of which implementation to use depends on 
which one would be more efficient for the application at hand. You can think of an ADT as a well-commented interface 
describing the operations that an implementing class must contain.

### An Analogy

**Consider a vending machine description as a physical analogy for an ADT.** From the outside perspective, 
users of a vending machine are only concerned with whether or not a machine _can_ vend. They don't necessarily 
care _how_ a machine vends. An operation for a vending machine might be described by the following method:

* `void vendItem(double payment, int item) throws UnavailableItemException, InsufficientPaymentException`
  * Users should be able to call a method called `vendItem`, specifying a payment amount and item number.
    If valid input is supplied, then the vending machine should vend the item to the user.
  * If the item is unavailable, then the method throws an `UnavailableItemException` which causes the
    vending machine's display to update accordingly.
  * Likewise, if an insufficient amount for the specified item is supplied, then the method throws
    an `InsufficientPaymentException` which also causes the vending machine's display to update accordingly.
    
In this analogy, we have a VendingMachine ADT with one operation called `vendItem`. Not only should
any vending machine implementation have a `vendItem` operation, but it should operate, from the user's
perspective, as described in the ADT description. 

**What does the ADT not describe?** It doesn't describe 
how the actual vending occurs. One vending machine implementation might use conveyor belts to vend an item,
while another vending machine implementation might use robotic arms to do the same. That is, different
vending machine manufacturers are responsible for the inner workings of their implementations so long
as the `vendItem` operation works as previously described. Take special care to notice that the ADT
description did not only describe what should happen under normal circumstances. It described what
should happen under exceptional circumstances as well. It did so without ever saying _how_ any of that
should be done.

## The List ADT

A common ADT is the List ADT. When thinking of a List as an abstract type, you can think of a List as an ordered collection 
of objects. There are a number of important operations needed for a List. Some common list operations include, but are not
limited to:

* Creating a new list.
* Retrieving an object in the list at a particular index.
* Adding an object to the list at a particular index.
* Removing an object from the list at a particular index.
* Clearing the list.
* Print the contents of the list.

The exact method signatures and behaviors of these methods may differ across various List ADT definitions. In this tutorial,
we will use the following definitions:

| Return Type | Method / Operation Name and Parameters | Description |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| N/A         | `List()`                       | Creates a new `List` object with an initial list size of zero. |
| `String`    | `get(int index)`               | Retrieves the object (String in this case) at the specified index. This method throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if the index is out of range `(index < 0 \|\| index >= size())` |
| `boolean`   | `add(int index, String s)`     | Inserts the specified object (String in this case) at the specified index. The method shifts the object currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent objects to the right (i.e. it adds one to  their indices). |
| `String`    | `remove(int index)`            | Removes and returns the string at the specified position in the list. Shifts any subsequent elements to the left (i.e. subtracts one from their indices). |
| `void`      | `clear()`                      | Removes all of the objects from the list. The list will be empty after this call returns. |
| `String`    | `makeString(String separator)` | Returns a string representation of this list with every string in the sequence separated by the specified separator string. |

Notice that the description and operations given above were independent of any underlying data structure or implementation.
When thinking of _using_ an ADT, try to avoid worrying about those details.

**List ADT Example**

In the example below, we provide a few List ADT method calls. It is worth highlighting again that we can understand 
this code without knowing any details of the underlying implementation. We recommend tracing through the code to see 
if you can get the same output shown below. Since we don't know what a List is at this point, you can represent the
`myList` using any structure you want.

   ```java
   List myList = new List();
   myList.add(0, "Bread");
   myList.add(0, "Cheese");
   myList.add(1, "Milk");
   myList.add(3, "Ice Cream");
   System.out.println("Removed: " + myList.remove(0));
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
Program Output:
   ```
   Removed: Cheese
   List Size: 3
   List Contents: Milk, Bread, Ice Cream
   ```
   
## Implementations of the List ADT

Now that we've seen how the List ADT is intended to function, we can focus on *how* to make it work. The List ADT is commonly 
implemented using either an array or a linked list. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks discussed below. 

### List ADT - Array Implementation

The List ADT can be implemented using an array of the type of object stored in the list. We use an array of `String`
references in our examples but this same structure could apply to any datatype. We also keep a variable, `size`, which 
represents the number of items on the list. The `size` variable is optional but recommended as it simplifies the 
implementation of many of the List ADT operations.

The main benefit of an array-based List implementation is extremely fast access to List elements. This is because 
arrays are laid out in a contiguous block of primary memory. The main drawback of an array-based approach is that
an array's size is fixed. Therefore, if you want to increase the size of an array, you are forced to create a new array of 
the larger size and subsequently copy over the elements of the old array to the new, larger array. As you can imagine, 
creating an array and copying all elements is an expensive operation for the CPU to perform â€” especially when the array 
size is large.

### List ADT - Linked List Implementation

A linked list is a sequence of objects where one object in the list references the next object in the list. The objects are
not laid out in contiguous memory and, therefore, access time is slower than an array-based implementation. We will see 
exactly why this is true later in the reading. The main benefit of linked lists is that new objects can be added to the list 
without having to create a copy of the entire List.

The objects in a linked list are commonly referred to as **nodes**. Each node contains the value to be stored along with a 
reference to the next node in the list. An abbreviated Java implementation of a `Node` class containing a `String` reference
can be seen below:

   ```java
   public class Node {
   
      private String value;
      private Node next;
      
      // constructors, getters and setters omitted for brevity
      
   } // Node
   ```
   
Here, the `next` instance variable is a reference (or link) to the next `Node` object in the linked list. Executing the 
code below would generate a linked list with two `Node` objects. The `next` reference contained within the first node, `n`,
references the second `Node` object. 

   ```java
   Node n = new Node("Hello");
   n.setNext(new Node("World"));
   ```
   
The structure generated by the above code would look like:

   ![Two Connected Nodes](res/Nodes.png)


A **linked list** is a sequence of nodes. Typically, a linked list object contains a `Node` reference to the **head** 
(front) of the list along with a `size` variable indicating how many items are in the list. Linking together `Node`
objects is an alternative way to store related data items.

## List ADT - Examples with Both Implementations

Let's take a look at how the array and linked list implementations would look internally after executing some of our 
List ADT methods. In the examples below, we show a few lines of Java code along with images demonstrating the internal 
state of the List object, `myList`, using both an array and a linked list as the internal data structure.

1. **Construct a new list.** Regardless of the implementation, a newly constructed list contains
   zero elements. Therefore, regardless of the underlying storage mechanism, a newly constructed
   list should have a list size of `0`.

   ```java
   List myList = ... // either `new ArrayBasedList();` or `new LinkedBasedList();`
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   List Size: 0
   List Contents:
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>
    In the array list implementation, a non-zero length array is created upon the initial construction of the list for potential future storage by the list.
   </td>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array1.png"></td>    
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>In the linked list implementation, no head node is created upon the initial construction of the list.</td>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked1.png"></td>    
   </tr>
   </table>
   
1. **Add element into index position 0.** Adding an item to index `0` conceptually adds the item
   to the beginning of the list. If this `add` operation is successful, then we expect the 
   list size to increase to `1`.

   ```java
   myList.add(0, "Bread");
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   List Size: 1
   List Contents: Bread
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array2.png"></td>
   <td>
    In the array list implementation, the item is stored at index position <code>0</code> within the array.
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked2.png"></td>
   <td>
    In the linked list implementation, a node object is created that contains the item, then
    <code>head</code> is assigned a reference to that node.</td>
   </tr>
   </table>
   
1. **Add another element into index position 0.** Remember, if the `add` method shifts the object 
   currently at that position (in this case, `"Bread"`) and any subsequent objects to the right 
   (i.e. it adds one to  their indices). Therefore, if this `add` operation is successful, then
   we expect `"Bread"` to shift to index position `1` and the list size to increase to `2`.

   ```java
   myList.add(0, "Cheese");
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   List Size: 2
   List Contents: Cheese, Bread
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>In the array list implementation, the current contents of the array were shifted to the right,
    as needed, and the item is stored at index position <code>0</code> within the array.</td>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array3.png"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>In the linked list implementation, a new node is created that contains the item, then
    the newly created node's <code>next</code> variable and the list head are updated accordingly.</td>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked3.png"></td>
   </tr>
   </table>
   
1. **Add element into index position 1.** Just like with the previous operation, some items in the 
   the list will conceptually shift to the right. 

   ```java
   myList.add(1, "Milk");
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   List Size: 3
   List Contents: Cheese, Milk, Bread
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>In the array list implementation, only the elements in indices <code>1</code> and greater are shifted
    to the right before the item is stored at index position <code>1</code> within the array.</td>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array4.png"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>In the linked list implementation, a new node is created that contains the item, then
    the <code>next</code> variable of both the newly created node and the node referred to by <code>head</code>
    are updated accordingly.</td>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked4.png"></td>
   </tr>
   </table>
      
1. **Add element into index position 3.** In this example, this conceptually places the item
   at the end of the list. 

   ```java
   myList.add(3, "Ice Cream");
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   List Size: 4
   List Contents: Cheese, Milk, Bread, Ice Cream
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array5.png"></td>
   <td>In the array list implementation, the internal array capacity needed to be increased before the item could be stored at index position <code>3</code> within the array.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked5.png"></td>
   <td>In the linked list implementation, a new node is created that contains the item, then
    the <code>next</code> variable of the node in list position <code>2</code> is updated accordingly.</td>
   </tr>
   </table>

1. **Remove the first element.** Remember, the `remove` operation will shift any subsequent elements
   in the list to the left (i.e. subtracts one from their indices). 
   
   ```java
   System.out.println("Removed: " + myList.remove(0));
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   Removed: Cheese
   List Size: 3
   List Contents: Milk, Bread, Ice Cream
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>In the array list implementation, the contents of the array at index position <code>1</code> and 
    greater were shifted to the left by one position.</td>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array6.png"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>In the linked list implementation, <code>head</code> is simply assigned a reference to the node that
    was previously referred to by the <code>next</code> variable in the first node.</td>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked6.png"></td>
   </tr>
   </table>

1. **Get the first element.** After all the changes to the list, we expect `"Milk"` to be the
   first item in the list.

   ```java
   System.out.println("Item at index 0: " + myList.get(0));
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   Item at index 0: Milk
   List Size: 3
   List Contents: Milk, Bread, Ice Cream
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array6.png"></td>
   <td>In the array list implementation, no changes are needed internally to accomodate this operation. 
    That location in the array can be accessed directly.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked6.png"></td>
   <td>In the linked list implementation, no changes are needed internally to accomodate this operation. 
    That location cannot be accessed directly; it must be reached starting with the node referred to by <code>head</code>.</td>
   </tr>
   </table>

1. **Clear.** After a list is cleared, it conceptually has no items.

   ```java
   myList.clear();
   System.out.println("List Size: " + myList.size());
   System.out.println("List Contents: " + myList.makeString(","));
   ```
   ```
   List Size: 0
   List Contents:
   ```
   
   <table>
   <tr>
   <td>In the array list implementation, the <code>size</code> is updated to <code>0</code>. It's up to the implementer whether or not
    the contents of the array are modified since the user of the list does not interact with them directly.</td>
   <td><img width="1500" src="res/Array7.png"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>In the linked list implementation, the <code>size</code> is updated to <code>0</code> and the <code>head</code> is set to <code>null</code>.</td>
   <td><img width="1500"  src="res/Linked1.png"></td>
   </tr>
   </table>

## Operation Details

In this section, we will take a closer look at the `get(int index)` and `add(int index, String s)` operations with a linked list
implementation.

### Linked List Get Operation

The main drawback of a linked list implementation is that elements are slower to access. Each access requires the program 
to traverse from the head of the list to the desired index. The images below demonstrate how this might be accomplished if
the instruction `myList.get(2)` is executed.

1. A reference, `temp`, is assigned to the `head` of the list (index 0). 

   ![First Get Image](res/Get1.png)

1. We move `temp` to the next node in the list. Now, `temp` is located at index 1. We avoid modifying `head` as to not 
   change the list itself. If we were to lose the `head` reference, we would lose access to the first node in the list.
   
   ![Second Get Image](res/Get2.png)

1. We move `temp` to the next node in the list. Now, `temp` is located at index 2, which is our desired destination. At 
   this point, we can return `value` from the `Node` object referenced by `temp` as that is the value we want.
   
   ![Third Get Image](res/Get3.png)

Compare this method to arrays where we would simply return `array[2]`. With an array implementation, the program can 
directly access the requested index (one of the benefits of arrays). Traversing the links in a linked list implementation
is more costly. Especially when the desired element is located toward the end of a long linked list.

### Linked List Add Operation

The main benefit of a linked list implementation is the fact that these structures can easily increase size by adding a 
new, dynamically allocated node object. The images below demonstrate how this might be accomplished if the instruction
`myList.add(2, "F")` is executed.

1. The method starts off by creating a `Node` object referenced by `newNode` containing the `String` to be added. Also,
   in this step, a temporary reference, `temp`, refers to the first node in the List.
   
   ![First Add Image](res/Add1.png)

1. We move `temp` to the next node in the list. Now, `temp` is located at index 1. We avoid modifying `head` as to not 
   change the list itself. If we were to lose the `head` reference, we would lose access to the first node in the list.
   
   ![Second Add Image](res/Add2.png)

1. Now that `temp` is located at the index directly preceding where we want to add, we can start modifying the references
   to correctly add `newNode` to our list. In this step, we set the `next` reference of `newNode` to the `next`
   value of `temp`.
   
   ![Third Add Image](res/Add3.png)
  
1. In this step, the `next` field of the object referenced by `temp` is set to `newNode`.

   ![Fourth Add Image](res/Add4.png)
   
1. This image represents the same structure as the previous image just redrawn without any local variables with the nodes
   lined up cleanly.
   
   ![Fifth Add Image](res/Add5.png)

**Compare the above steps to the array list add operation.**
When there is space in the array for the new item, the linked list is much slower, comparatively. 
However, if there is not enough space in the array for the new item, then the linked list
add operation is usually much faster! This is because it avoids the creation of a new array object
and the loop required to transfer the contents from the old array to the new one.

## Conclusion

The chosen implementation of an interface can have a large impact on the program in which it is used. Selecting the 
appropriate implementation is an important decision. In this tutorial, we discussed a linked list vs array implementation
for the List ADT. The benefits and drawbacks of each approach are summarized in the table below:

   |        | Array Approach          | Linked List Approach      |
   |--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
   | Pros   | Fast Access to Elements | Easy to Add new Nodes     |
   | Cons   | Expensive to Resize     | Slower access to elements |
