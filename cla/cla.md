# Command-Line Arguments

![Approved for: Fall 2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Fall%202024-green)

When working in a Unix-like environment, programs are launched when the user
enters the program's name into the shell (i.e., they type it in, then press
return). Many programs allow or even require the user to specify additional
pieces of information, called **command-line arguments**, after the program's
name to adjust the program's settings and supply values that the
program needs to execute. For example, consider using `ls` to list all of the
entries in `~/public_html` using the long listing format (`-l`), including
hidden files that begin with a dot `.` (`-a`):

```
$ ls -l -a ~/public_html
```

In the example above, the base command (program) is `ls` and the command-line 
arguments used are `-l`, `-a`, and `~/public_html`. Each of the command-line 
arguments provide information to the program about how it should run.

When the program is launched, the command-line arguments are passed into
the program through its `main` method. The program reads these values as
input and determines how to respond. Like many Unix programs, `ls` is
written in C, but support for command-line arguments extends to other
languages as well, including Java. Let's try it!

1. Create a directory for this tutorial called `cs1302-cla`, then change into it.

1. Create a `src` and `bin` directory, then create the `.java` file for a class
   called `ArgTester` and place `ArgTester.java` in the `src` directory.

   ```
   cs1302-cla
   ├── bin
   └── src
       └── ArgTester.java
   ```

1. In `ArgTester.java`, add the declaration for the `ArgTester` class.

1. In your `ArgTester` class, add the following `main` method:

   ```java
   public static void main(String [] args) {
       System.out.println("arguments:");
       for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
           String arg = args[i];
           System.out.printf("args[%d] = %s\n", i, arg);
       } // for
   } // main
   ```

1. Take a few minutes to carefully read through the code above. Try and understand what it's doing.
   Note: Up until this point, you've always typed `String[] args` as a parameter to `main` but you've
   probably never used it. That parameter is a reference to an array containing the command-line arguments.

1. Compile the `ArgTester` class, specifying `bin` as the destination directory.

   ```
   javac -d bin ArgTester.java
   ```

1. Run `ArgTester` as usual using the `java` command. Here is what the command looks
   like with the expected program output, assuming you are running it from the `cs1302-cla`
   directory:

   ```
   $ java -cp bin ArgTester
   arguments:
   ```

   As you can see, no iterations of the for-loop were executed. This is expected as the `args` array would
   be empty in this scenario (there are no command-line arguments provided).

1. Now try the following command:

   ```
   $ java -cp bin ArgTester one two three
   ```

   What happened when you ran it? It looks like the for-loop iterated. The array referred to by `args` is not
   empty. That's right, we've used the `args` array for something! Here's the
   expected output:

   ```
   arguments:
   args[0] = one
   args[1] = two
   args[2] = three
   ```

   In Java, the `args` array of a standard `main` method is used to capture command-line
   arguments and make them available to the program.

1. Now that we see how to access the command-line arguments in our code, let's see how
   different command-line arguments are parsed. Try the following commands:

   ```
   $ java -cp bin ArgTester "one two" three
   ```

   ```
   $ java -cp bin ArgTester --help "some topic"
   ```

   ```
   $ java -cp bin ArgTester --string "my \"awesome\" day"
   ```

2. That's it! The rest is purely in the realm of code. We've shown you how command-line
   arguments are passed into a Java program (i.e., via the `args` array). Now, experiment
   by adding some command-line options of your own.
