# Java Generics

One of the most powerful features of Java is its support for generics. Generics
is a language feature that enables us to write code that operates on various
datatypes while still providing compile-time type safety. One way to write
such code relies heavily on the use of the `Object` type and casting; however,
this often leads to programming mistakes that are not caught until run-time.
With generics, we can can write the desired code a way that avoids casting
and enables compile-time checking.
