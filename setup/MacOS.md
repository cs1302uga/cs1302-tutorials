# Setup on macOS

![Approved for: Spring 2025](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Spring%202025-blue)

The following instructions are designed to help get you up and running with macOS for development
in CSCI 1302. The majority of the time, you will not be developing directly on your Mac. Instead,
you will use your Mac to connect to a remote server via a terminal emulator. Once connected, the
commands that you type and the programs that you run will be executed on the remote server instead
of on your local machine.

## Setup `Ctrl-<SPACE>` 

If typing `Ctrl-<SPACE>` (i.e., `⌃Space`) changes your keyboard layout, then you will need to
adjust some settings as that keyboard shortcut is used heavily in one of the programs we'll
be using this semester. **If it doesn't, then you can skip to the next section.**

To fix `Ctrl-<SPACE>`, click the apple icon in the top-left of your screen then select "System Preferences". 
From there, go to the "Keyboard Settings" which may be just called "Keyboard", then select the
"Shortcuts" tab. Find the shortcut that is mapped to `⌃Space` and either change it
or disable it. Once you've made the change, you should be all set as far as 
`Ctrl-<SPACE>` is concerned.

## Open Terminal

The macOS operating system comes with a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
called [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac).

1. **Open Terminal.** On your Mac, do one of the following:
   * Click the Launchpad icon 
     <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/5B9190B30946221279C5A608/5B9190B30946221279C5A60F/en_US/3cc1cbefea3e97e575172177e505b7a9.png" width="15" height="15">
     in the Dock, type `Terminal` in the search field, then click **Terminal**.
   * Click the Spotlight icon 
     <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/605932B4A1B7A93F492858E8/605932C0A1B7A93F492858FF/en_US/bb4de0babc81c7fedb3e9663d00d7a3a.png" width="15" height="15">
     in the upper-right corner of the menu bar (or press Command-Space), type `Terminal` in the search field, 
     then click **Terminal**.
   * In the Finder 
     <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/5B9190B30946221279C5A608/5B9190B30946221279C5A60F/en_US/937fa92677a2c49a18fa81070e5d8419.png" width="15" height="15">, 
     open the `/Applications/Utilities` folder, then double-click **Terminal**.
     
2. **Explore.** At its core, macOS is powered by a powerful Unix-like kernel called 
   [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)). 
   Using Terminal, you can interact with your system using most Unix commands.

## Use Option as Meta

Some of the programs that you will use this semester will require the use of the META key. 
On some systems, this is the same as the ESC or ALT key. On a Mac, you can set Terminal to 
use the OPTION key as META. 

1. **Open Terminal.**
2. In the menu bar, click **Terminal**, then click **Settings...**.
3. In the window that appears, select the **Profiles** option at the top.
4. In the tabs that appear below **Profiles**, select the **Keyboard** tab.
5. Near the bottom of the pane, check the box for **Use Option as Meta key.**
   - **The setting does not take effect immediately!** 
     It will take effect the next time you open **Terminal**.
6. Quit the **Terminal** app by selecting **Quit Terminal** from the **File** menu (or by
   pressing ⌘Q). 

## Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for MacOS. It makes it really easy to install programs
on your Mac via [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac). 

1. **Open Terminal.**

2. **Install Homebrew.** 
   To do this, you will need to type a command at the prompt.
   
   1. When presenting commands, we often prepend the start of a command line with a `$` 
      to denote the shell prompt. The `$` lets you know that the line that follows is 
      something that you should type into your terminal emulator at the shell prompt, 
      which usually ends with `$` pr `%` followed by a white space. 
      **Do not type or copy the `$` before the command name as it is not part of the command.**

   2. When installing Homebrew, the installer may ask you for a password. If it does, then
      it is referring to the password for your Mac.
      
   3. To run the Homebrew installer, type the following command:
   
      ```
      $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
      ```
      
   4. Homebrew must be installed to continue. If installation fails, inspect the messages emitted
      by the installer -- in most cases, it will tell you what you need to do to fix
      the issues that are preventing installation.

3. **Install Utilities via Homebrew.** Type the following command to install [git](https://git-scm.com/)
   and [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/):
   
   ```
   $ brew install git wget
   ```
   
   **If you run into issues with `brew install`**, then please try running `brew doctor` first to see
   if it has a suggested fix. If it does, then try the fix. If it doesn't or if it does but that doesn't
   resolve your issue, then you may need to ask Piazza or see an instructor during office hours. 
   
## Install XQuartz

[XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) is an open-source version of the 
[X.Org X Window System](http://www.x.org/) that runs on MacOS.
Installing XQuartz will enable you to forward the graphical user interface
for remote programs that you write later in the semester to your local machine.

1. **Open Terminal.**

2. **Install XQuartz.** Type the following command:
3. 
   ```
   $ brew install --cask xquartz
   ```
   
3. **Restart your Mac.** The best way to restart your Mac is to choose Restart from the Apple () menu.
