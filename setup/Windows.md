# Setup on Windows 10 & 11

![Approved for: Spring 2024](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Spring%202024-blue)

The following instructions are designed to help get you up and running with a Windows 10 or 11
PC for development in CSCI 1302. The majority of the time, you will not be developing directly on 
your PC. Instead, you will use your PC to connect to a remote server via a terminal emulator. Once 
connected, the commands that you type and the programs that you run will be executed on the remote 
server instead of on your local machine.

## Install MobaXterm

For Windows 10, we recommend the use of a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
called [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).

1. Download and install the free Home version of MobaXterm (Installer edition) at the link presented below:

   **WARNING:** If you download a `.zip` file for one of the MobaXterm installers, then you need to fully
   extract the `.zip` file into a folder before attempting to install. Do not attempt to run the installer
   from within the `.zip` file. Instead, run the installer program from within the folder that you extract to.

   **Note:** Your window may look slightly different than below. If you see "Extract All" instead of "Extract", go
   ahead and click that button. You can choose the default location as the place to extract. It will likely use
   your `Downloads` folder for the extracted files. Once it's extracted, you can double-click the installer to begin
   the installation process.

## Setup Backspace (Required)

MobaXterm often modifies the backspace key to send `C-h` (`^H`) instead of the 
proper backspace key code. This can cause problems if you regularly use the 
backspace key to perform backward deletions (very common). To fix this issue, 
follow these steps:

1. Open **MobaXterm**.
2. In the menu bar, click **Settings**, then click **Configuration**. 
3. In the window that appears, select the **Terminal** tab if not selected already.
4. Near the bottom of the window, make sure the checkbox for **Backspace sends ^H** is
   *unchecked*, then click the **OK** button to close the window.
   - **The setting does not take effect immediately!** 
     It will take effect the next time you open **MobaXterm**.
6. Quit **MobaXterm** app by selecting **Quit** from the **Terminal** menu.

If this is the first time you are reading these instructions, then make a note
to yourself to return to this section if you encounter backspace issues with
MobaXterm in the future. The steps below should only be taken if you
are returning here to resolve a backspace issue:

1. First, try repeating the steps above to *uncheck* the **Backspace sends ^H** 
   setting -- remember to quit and relaunch **MobaXterm** before attempting to 
   verify that your issue is fixed.
   
2. If you still encounter backspace issues, then **MobaXterm** may not be honoring
   the *unchecked* state of the **Backspace sends ^H** setting. To remedy that, 
   open **MobaXterm**, launch a local terminal, but **do NOT connect to Odin**.
   Instead, enter the commands below to deploy a configuration file that should 
   fix the issue:
   
   ```
   $ wget http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~mec/cs1302/mobaxterm.bashrc
   $ mv mobaxterm.bashrc .bashrc
   $ source .bashrc
   ```
   
   Now, you should be able to `ssh` into Odin with MobaXterm and have your
   beautiful backspace key work as intended!

## Setup `Ctrl-<SPACE>` and `Ctrl-X` (Required)

In newer versions of MobaXterm, `Ctrl-<SPACE>` (`Ctrl + SPACE`) and `Ctrl-X` (`Ctrl + Shift + X`) 
may be mapped to MobaXterm-specific shortcuts. This will cause problems when it comes time to
work in Emacs as those key combinations are used quite often. Please update
your MobaXterm settings by doing the following steps:

   1. Select "Settings" from the menu bar, then "Keyboard shortcuts".
   1. In the window that appears, find and select the shortcut for "Ctrl-SPACE" or "Ctrl + SPACE".
   1. Once selected, find the "Edit keyboard shortcut" dropdown list and
      change it to "" or `<none>` (which should be at the top of the list).
   1. Repeat the previous step on the shortcut for "Ctrl-X" or "Ctrl + Shift + X".
   1. Select "OK". The issue should now be resolved.
