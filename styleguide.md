## Guidelines

### FileTabCharacter

No tab characters (`\t`) are allowed in the whitespace of the source code.
This does not include tabs in string literals. For example, the following
snippet is okay:

```java
String s = "word1\tword2";
```

**Rationale:** 
Use of tabs instead of spaces may result in different text editors displaying
same file in different ways, depending on the tab width configured for the
given editor. Developers should not need to configure the tab width of their 
text editors in order to be able to read source code.

### LineLength

You should limit the number of characters, including whitespace, on any given 
line to 100 characters. Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this 
limit must be manually line-wrapped in a consistent manner. Exceptions to the 
column limit include:
* lines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL
  in Javadoc, or a long JSNI method reference);
* package and import statements; and
* command line input examples in a comment that may be cut-and-pasted into a shell.

**Rationale:** Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers have 
limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the editor displays additional 
information like line numbers, multiple files, project tree, class hierarchy, etc.
