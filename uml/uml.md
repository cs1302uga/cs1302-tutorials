## Introduction

In object-oriented programming, it's not uncommon to visualize classes
and their relationships using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
While UML has many different types of diagrams, this reading focuses only
on UML class diagrams.

### Basic Class Diagram

Consider the following UML class diagram:

![cs1302.example.Person Class](img/cs1302.example.Person.png)

The diagram consists of a rectangle broken up vertically into three sections:

1. **Class name.** In this case, the fully qualified name of the class is given.
   Sometimes, if multiple classes are given and assumed to be in the same package,
   then the simple name is used here instead.

1. **Variables.** In UML, the variables of a class are called _attributes_. In
   this example, there are two private instance variables (indicated with a `-`)
   and one private static variable. In UML, attributes and methods are shown
   to be public with a `+` symbol to the left of the name. Static variables are underlined.

1. **Methods.** In UML, the methods of a class are called _operations_. In this
   example, there is one public constructor, two public (indicated by `+`) instance
   methods, and one public static method. In UML, attributes and methods are shown
   to be public with a `+` symbol to the left of the name. Static methods are underlined.

The diagram above gives enough information for a programmer (or a program) to generate the following
`Person.java` file:

```java
package cs1302.example;

public class Person {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private static int personCounter;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        ...
    } // Person

    public String getName() {
        ...
    } // getName

    public int getAge() {
        ...
    } // getAge

    public static int getPersonCounter() {
        ...
    } // getPersonCounter

} // Person
```

### Visibilities

UML supports the standard four visibilities:

| Visibility Name | Modifier Keyword | UML Symbol |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| private         | `private`        | `-`        |
| package private |                  | `~`        |
| protected       | `protected`      | `#`        |
| public          | `public`         | `+`        |

You should be familiar with at least two of these visibilities (`public` and `private`). If you would like to read ahead to
learn about the other two, see the [Visibility Reading](/visibility/) which we will cover soon.

### Atributes and Parameters (Variables)

In UML, attributes and parameters are written in the following format:

```
visibility name : type
```

### Operations (Methods)

In UML, operations are written in the following format:

```
visibility [<<stereotype>>] methodName(param1: type, param2: type): returnType
```

### Stereotypes

A _stereotype_ is optional and is used to convey additional information. For
example, you might use the following stereotypes in different situations:

| Stereotype      | Description          |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `<<new>>`       | Denotes constructor. |
| `<<abstract>>`  | Denotes abstract.    |
| `<<override>>`  | Denotes override.    |
| `<<interface>>` | Denotes interface.   |
| `<<final>>`     | Denotes final.       |

### Abstract Classes and Operations

The usual way to denote that a class or operation is abstract is to italicize the
name of the class or operation. Sometimes this is impractical in situations where it's
difficult to discern the difference between the normal lettering of a font and
its italicized version. In such cases, the names might also be prefixed with
an `<<abstract>>` stereotype to better communicate the intention to the
viewer of the diagram.

To illustrate the differences, consider the following three `Shape` classes:

![Abstract Comparison](img/abstract.png)

In the diagram, the first class on the left is not abstract and the other two
are. While the italics in the middle class indicate that it is abstract, it
can be easily confused as a non-abstract class if viewed quickly. For this
reason, we suggest you italicize and use a stereotype to indicate that a
class is abstract just as is done with the third class in the diagram.

### Associations

When you have more than one class in a diagram, you often want to express
how they are associated. In UML, this is done with association arrows.
While UML supports many different kinds of association arrows, the following
are arguably the most common:

| Association                       | Description                               | Usage                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ![uses](img/uses.svg)             | Solid line; open arrowhead.               | `ClassA` uses `ClassB`                 |
| ![extends](img/extends.svg)       | Solid line; unfilled triangle arrowhead.  | `Child` extends `Parent`               |
| ![implements](img/implements.svg) | Dashed line; unfilled triangle arrowhead. | `SomeClass` implements `SomeInterface` |

**It may seem nitpicky,** but each of these arrows is visually different
with respect to its line and its arrowhead!

## UML Software and Tools

Before you continue reading, it's important to note that you do not need a special program to work with UML.
It's quite possible (and encouraged) that you practice drawing UML diagrams by hand either on paper or in
your note-taking software. The purpose of a UML class diagram is to help visualize multiple classes and
their relationships. Over the years, we've seen many students skip directly to using UML software and
get frustrated. Since these programs have a learning curve, students spend too much time trying to
figure out, for example, how to mark something as protected in the program when they could have simply
written `#` had they done it by hand. Don't get us wrong, these tools are great, and if you want to learn
them, then you should. Just try to make sure it doesn't impact your productivity, especially near a
deadline.

Below is a list of popular UML software programs. **You are not required to have access to one for
this course.** While many of these programs do require a paid license, you are encouraged to seek
out a free community edition or a free/reduced-price student license before making any purchases.
If you find a tool that's not on the list, then please share it on Piazza!

You may be surprised by how much a regular license costs for some of the programs above. In practice,
if you need a program like this for your job, then it's not uncommon for your company to
pay for the license just as many companies do for programs like Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, etc.
