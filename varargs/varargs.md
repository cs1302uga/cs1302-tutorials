# Variable Arguments (Varargs) Reading

## Introduction

In Java, varargs enable us to write methods that accept a variable number
of arguments of the same type. Consider the usual way to do this using an
array. Here is an example of a `printlns` method in a class called `Helper`
that prints out each element of an array on its own line 
(full code [here](src/cs1302/util/Helper.java)):

```java
/**
 * Calls {@code out.println(arg)} for each {@code arg} in {@code args}.
 * @param out   desired output stream
 * @param args  arguments to print
 */
public static void printlns(PrintStream out, String[] args) {
    for (String arg : args) {
        out.println(arg);
    } // for
} // printlns
```

Then, [elsewhere](src/cs1302/util/Driver.java), you might call 
the `printlns` method like this:

```java
// elsewhere
Helper.printlns(System.out, new String[] { "a", "b", "c" });
Helper.printlns(System.out, new String[] { "d", "e" });
Helper.printlns(System.out, new String[] { "f" });
Helper.printlns(System.out, new String[] { "g", "h", "i", "j", "k" });
```

However, the code snippet above is a little tedious because it requires
the creation and use of an array. **The following will not work as-is, 
but it would be nice _if we could make it work_:**

```java
// elsewhere
Helper.printlns(System.out, "a", "b", "c");
Helper.printlns(System.out, "d", "e");
Helper.printlns(System.out, "f");
Helper.printlns(System.out, new String[] { "g", "h", "i", "j", "k" });
```

To facilitate this, your first instinct might be to create a set
of method _overloads_ for the `printlns` method. That's a good thought;
however, it would also be tedious. How many parameters will the
method need? Is it three? Two? One? We don't really know ahead of time. 
This is where a **varargs declaration** comes into play:

```java
/**
 * Calls {@code out.println(arg)} for each {@code arg} in {@code args}.
 * @param out   desired output stream
 * @param args  arguments to print
 */
public static void printlns(PrintStream out, String... args) {
    for (String arg : args) {
        out.println(arg);
    } // for
} // printlns
```

Changing `String[] args` to `String... args` accomplishes two things:

1. the `printlns` method can now be called with zero or more trailing
   `String` parameters; and
   
1. the `printlns` method can _still_ be called with a `String[]` parameter.

**Try it!** Modify the supplied [`Helper`](src/cs1302/util/Helper.java) class to
make its `printlns` method accept a variable number of trailing `String`
arguments. The lines of code that would not work earlier should all work
after you've changed the `args` parameter to have a varargs declaration.
You may also find it helpful to test various inputs to the `printlns`
method using the associated [`Driver`](src/cs1302/util/Driver.java)
class.

## Technical Details

1. A method may only contain a single `varargs` declaration.

1. If a method contains a varargs declaration, then it must be at the end.
