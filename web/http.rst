Quick Introduction to HTTP
**************************

.. |wiki_WWW| replace:: World Wide Web
.. _wiki_WWW: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web

.. |wiki_URL| replace:: URL
.. _wiki_URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL

.. |wiki_URI| replace:: URI
.. _wiki_URI: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI

.. |web_server| replace:: web server

HTTP stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol", the protocol that defines
the standard data exchange procedure used by the |wiki_WWW|_ (i.e., the "web").
Whenever a program (e.g., a web browser) tries to access web content (i.e.,
content located at a ``http://``-prefixed or ``https://``-prefixed |wiki_URL|_
or |wiki_URI|_), it uses an **HTTP client** (web client) to communicate with the
**HTTP server** (web server) that hosts the content. Sometimes the program itself
is an HTTP client (i.e., it knows all the protocol details); however, it's more
common these days to use an HTTP client provided by a library.

From a program's perspective, the following steps are taken to access web content:

1. construct an HTTP request message;
2. use an HTTP client to send the HTTP request message to the HTTP server;
3. (hopefully) receive an HTTP response message; then
4. decide how to update its program state.

Here is diagram that illustrates the entire high-level data exchange
that might occur when a program attempts to access content hosted
by an HTTP server:

.. |http_spec| replace:: HTTP/1.1 specification
.. _http_spec: https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html

If you're interested in the low-level details of HTTP, then we
encourage you to take a Computer Networks class, read the
|http_spec|_, or both!


Java's ``java.net.http`` Library
********************************

.. |java_net_http| replace:: ``java.net.http``
.. _java_net_http: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/package-summary.html

Java (versions >=11) ships with |java_net_http|_, a package that provides
classes and interfaces that understand HTTP. It enables Java programs to
access web content without worrying about the low-level details of the
data exchange we described earlier. In this reading, we are going to
focus on these three types:

==============================  =============================================================
Class                           Description
==============================  =============================================================
``java.net.http.HttpRequest``   Represents an HTTP request.
``java.net.http.HttpClient``    Used to send HTTP requests and receive their HTTP responses.
``java.net.http.HttpResponse``  Represents an HTTP response.
==============================  =============================================================

.. |HttpRequest| replace:: ``HttpRequest``
.. _HttpRequest: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpRequest.html

.. |HttpClient| replace:: ``HttpClient``
.. _HttpClient: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html

.. |HttpResponse| replace:: ``HttpResponse<T>``
.. _HttpResponse: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpResponse.html

Some complete code examples that involve all three types are included near the end
of the reading.

|HttpRequest|
+++++++++++++

.. |builder_pattern| replace:: builder pattern
.. _builder_pattern: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern

.. |HttpClient_newBuilder| replace:: ``HttpClient.newBuilder()``
.. _HttpClient_newBuilder: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html#newBuilder()

.. |HttpRequest_Builder| replace:: ``HttpRequest.Builder``
.. _HttpRequest_Builder: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpRequest.Builder.html

.. |HttpRequest_newBuilder| replace:: ``HttpRequest.newBuilder()``
.. _HttpRequest_newBuilder: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpRequest.html#newBuilder()

.. |URI| replace:: URI
.. _URI: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html

The |HttpRequest|_ class provided by |java_net_http|_ allows Java programs
to "build" HTTP request messages that can be sent using an HTTP client. Instead of
providing a public constructor, the authors of |HttpRequest| decided to use
the |builder_pattern| — |HttpRequest| objects are constructed by *building*
them using an |HttpRequest_Builder|_ object returned from |HttpRequest_newBuilder|_.
The authors' use of the |builder_pattern| prevents the construction of
incomplete request objects and provides a nice alternative to potentially
complex looking constructor calls.

Most of the methods provided by |HttpRequest_Builder|
merely update the request information stored in the builder object, then just
return a reference to builder object itself so that you can update it further
via additional method calls. Once all the request information is specified,
the ``build()`` method is called to construct the actual |HttpRequest|
object. The following two code snippets build a request object using the
exact same statement — the second snippet distributes the statement across
several lines to make it easier to read:

.. code-block:: java

   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder().uri(location).build();

.. code-block:: java

   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
       .uri(location) // sets the HttpRequest's URI
       .build();      // builds and returns an HttpRequest

The HTTP specification requires that requests indicate their purpose and
expectations regarding a successful result by setting a request *method*
value. By default, |HttpRequest_Builder| builds "GET" requests that ask
an HTTP server to include the requested content in the body of the
response message that is sent back to the client. The following two
code snippets build the same "GET" request:

.. code-block:: java

   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
       .uri(location) // sets the HttpRequest's URI
       .GET();        // sets the HttpRequest's request method to GET
       .build();      // builds and returns an HttpRequest

.. code-block:: java

   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
       .uri(location) // sets the HttpRequest's URI
       .build();      // builds and returns an HttpRequest


Other request *method* values  are outside the scope of this
reading; however, readers who are interested should note that |HttpRequest_Builder|
does include Java methods to specify a different request *method*
value if "GET" is not what you need.

Here is an example that builds an |HttpRequest| for an image:

.. code-block:: java

   URI location = URI.create("http://csweb.cs.uga.edu/~mec/cs1302/gui/pikachu.png");
   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
       .uri(location) // sets this HttpRequest's request URI
       .build();      // builds and returns an HttpRequest.

.. |java_net_URI| replace:: ``URI``
.. _java_net_URI: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html

**NOTE:** The classes and interfaces in |java_net_http| use the |java_net_URI| class
to represent location / address information for web content. You are likely familiar with
the concept of a URL; all URLs are also `URIs <URI>`__.

**NOTE:** |ex1|_ demonstrates how to build a request for an image and create
a JavaFX ``Image`` object using the data included in the body of the associated
response.

.. |GitHubApi| replace:: GitHub REST API
.. _GitHubApi: https://docs.github.com/en/rest

.. |get_a_license| replace:: get a license
.. _get_a_license: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/licenses#get-a-license

Some HTTP servers host Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
that we can interact with using HTTP requests — instead of a URI referring to
a "page" or "file", it refers to structured "data" that our program might
leverage to accomplish some goal. For example, the |GitHubApi| provides
URIs for accessing information stored by GitHub. Since GitHub supports many
open source projects, their API provides a URI for structured data about
open source software licenses. The example below builds an
|HttpRequest| to |get_a_license|_ (in this case, the MIT license) using the
|GitHubApi|. According to GitHub's API documentation, they recommend setting the
"Accept" header when building a request — headers are one way to provide an HTTP server with more
information about a request. Here is the code:

.. code-block:: java

   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
       .uri(URI.create("https://api.github.com/licenses/MIT"))
       .header("Accept", "application/vnd.github.v3.text-match+json")
       .build();

.. |GSON| replace:: Gson
.. _GSON: https://github.com/google/gson

.. |JSON| replace:: JSON
.. _JSON: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

**NOTE:** |ex2|_ demonstrates how to build a request for license data and
use the Google |GSON|_ library to parse the JSON-formatted string included in
the body of the associated response.

.. |query_string| replace:: query string
.. _query_string: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string

.. |itunes_search_api| replace:: iTunes Search API
.. _itunes_search_api: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html

.. |URLEncoder_encode| replace:: ``URLEncoder.encode``
.. _URLEncoder_encode: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URLEncoder.html#encode(java.lang.String,java.nio.charset.Charset)

.. |StandardCharsets_UTF_8| replace:: ``StandardCharsets.UTF_8``
.. _StandardCharsets_UTF_8: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/charset/StandardCharsets.html#UTF_8

Some HTTP servers also let you specify request metadata using
a special |query_string|_ included near the end of the request URI.
Special care must be taken when including a query string in a URI
so that the metadata values are encoded properly using a combination
of |URLEncoder_encode|_ and |StandardCharsets_UTF_8|_.
The example below builds an |HttpRequest| that queries the
|itunes_search_api| for up to 5 records related to "Daft Punk".

.. code-block:: java

   String term = URLEncoder.encode("daft punk", StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // "daft+punk"
   String limit = URLEncoder.encode("5", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);        // "5"
   String query = String.format("?term=%s&limit=%s", term, limit);       // "?term=daft+punk&limit=5"

   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
       .uri(URI.create("https://itunes.apple.com/search" + query))
       .build();

**NOTE:** |ex3|_ demonstrates how to build a request for the iTunes Search API
and use the Google |GSON|_ library to parse the JSON-formatted string included
in the body of the associated response.

|HttpClient|
++++++++++++

The |HttpClient|_ class provided by |java_net_http|_ includes a ``send`` method to
send an HTTP request message (described by an |HttpRequest|_ object) and return the
corresponding HTTP response message (described as an |HttpResponse|_ object).
The |HttpClient| class also uses the |builder_pattern|_ for object creation.

Here is a quick example that builds an |HttpClient| with preferred, modern
settings:

.. code-block:: java

   HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newBuilder()
       .version(HttpClient.Version.HTTP_2)           // uses HTTP protocol version 2 where possible
       .followRedirects(HttpClient.Redirect.NORMAL)  // always redirects, except from HTTPS to HTTP
       .build();                                     // builds and returns an HttpClient

Since a single |HttpClient| object can be used to send multiple requests, you are
encouraged to only create one |HttpClient| object for your program, unless a
specific need to do otherwise arises — you might do this by defining a static
constant:

.. code-block:: java

   public static final HttpClient HTTP_CLIENT = HttpClient.newBuilder()
       .version(HttpClient.Version.HTTP_2)           // uses HTTP protocol version 2 where possible
       .followRedirects(HttpClient.Redirect.NORMAL)  // always redirects, except from HTTPS to HTTP
       .build();                                     // builds and returns an HttpClient


.. |HttpClient_send| replace:: ``send``
.. _HttpClient_send: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html#send(java.net.http.HttpRequest,java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandler)

.. |HttpResponse_BodyHandler| replace:: ``HttpResponse.BodyHandler<T>``
.. _HttpResponse_BodyHandler: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpResponse.BodyHandler.html

.. |HttpResponse_BodyHandlers| replace:: ``HttpResponse.BodyHandlers``
.. _HttpResponse_BodyHandlers: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.html

Once built, an |HttpClient| object's |HttpClient_send|_ method can be called
to send an |HttpRequest|_; when doing so, an |HttpResponse_BodyHandler|_ must
also be supplied so that the |HttpClient| object knows how to construct
the |HttpResponse|_ object is creates for the response message. The
|HttpResponse_BodyHandlers|_ class provides some static methods to create
create commonly used |HttpResponse_BodyHandler| objects:

================================  =========================  ===================
Method                            Response Type              Response Body Type
================================  =========================  ===================
``BodyHandlers.ofString()``       ``Response<String>``       ``String``
``BodyHandlers.ofInputStream()``  ``Response<InputStream>``  ``InputStream``
================================  =========================  ===================

In the example below, we access a copy of *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* by Arthur Conan Doyle
that is hosted by Project Gutenberg — when we send the request, we use ``BodyHandlers.ofString()``
to inform the client that we want it to interpret the body of the response
(i.e., the response content) as a string.

.. code-block:: java

   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
       .uri(URI.create("https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-0.txt"))
       .build();
   HttpResponse<String> response = HTTP_CLIENT.send(response. BodyHandlers.ofString());
   String body = response.body();

**NOTE:** A rewritten version of the code above is provided in |ex0|_ so that
you can see it alongside the required exception handling.

|HttpResponse|
++++++++++++++

If an HTTP response message is received, then the program must decide what to
do based on the information contained in that response message. This information
can be accessed by calling methods on the associated |HttpResponse|_ object.
Here are some typical examples:

===========  ================  ============================  ==================================
|HttpResponse|_                Details
-----------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------
Information  Method            Description                   Note
===========  ================  ============================  ==================================
body         ``body()``        The content of the response.  The return type of ``body()``
                                                             is determined by the the
                                                             |HttpResponse_BodyHandler|_ that
                                                             was used to |HttpClient_send|_
                                                             the request.

===========  ================  ============================  ==================================

.. |http_status_here| replace:: here
.. _http_status_here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

Here is a generic method that you can use to throw an exception if the
status code of a supplied response is not ``200`` (OK) — you can see it
used in several of the code examples provided in the `Complete Examples`_
section:

.. code-block:: java

   /**
    * Throw an {@link java.io.IOException} if the HTTP status code of the
    * {@link java.net.http.HttpResponse} supplied by {@code response} is
    * not {@code 200 OK}.
    * @param <T> response body type
    * @param response response to check
    * @see <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7231.html#status.200">[RFC7232] 200 OK</a>
    */
   private static <T> void ensureGoodResponse(HttpResponse<T> response) throws IOException {
       if (response.statusCode() != 200) {
           throw new IOException(response.toString());
       } // if
   } // ensureGoodResponse
