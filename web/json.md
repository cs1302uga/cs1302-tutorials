# JSON

## Quick Introduction to JSON

JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation", a text format for storing
data in strings based on the JavaScript programming language. You do not
need to know JavaScript to use JSON — the two are completely
independent, and many libraries exist in various programming languages
to let us work with the format instead of writing it by hand. Here is a
small example of a JSON-formatted string constructed by hand using Java
code:

```java
String nl = "\n";
String jsonString = "{     " + nl
    + "  \"name\": \"Jay\"," + nl
    + "  \"age\": \"19\",  " + nl
    + "  \"classes\": [    " + nl
    + "    \"CSCI 1302\",  " + nl
    + "    \"CSCI 1730\"   " + nl
    + "  ]                 " + nl
    + "}                   ";
System.out.println(jsonString);
```

Here is the output for that example — once printed, the JSON-formatted
string looks really nice:

```json
{
  "name": "Jay",
  "age": "19",
  "classes": [
    "CSCI 1302",
    "CSCI 1730",
    "CSCI 2610"
  ]
}
```

In a JSON-formatted string,

-   `""` is used to denote a *key* or literal *value*;
-   `{}` is used to denote an *object*; and
-   `[]` is used to denote an array.

With that in mind, let's consider a Java class that might organize its
instance data in a similar to way to the object described by the
JSON-formatted string from earlier:

```java
public class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    String[] classes;
} // Student
```

Now that we have a Java class to represent the same kind of information,
we can use Google's Gson\_ library to parse the JSON-formatted string
directly into a `Student` object using the fromJson\_ method. The
example below assumes that Gson is added as a project dependency and
that a `Gson` object is available via `GSON` — instructions describing
how to add Gson to a Maven project are included later in this reading:

```java
// parse JSON-formatted string into a Student object
Student jay = GSON.fromJson(jsonString, Example4.Student.class);

// inspect the result
System.out.println(jay.name);
System.out.println(jay.age);
System.out.println("Classes:");
for (int i = 0; i < jay.classes.length; i++) {
    String className = jay.classes[i];
    System.out.println(" - " + className);
} // for
```

Here is the expected output:

```
Jay
19
Classes:
 - CSCI 1302
 - CSCI 1730
 - CSCI 2610
```

**NOTE:** An extended version of this example can be seen in
`cs1302.web/cs1302.web.Example4`\_.

## Complete Examples

Several complete and working code examples accompany this reading so
that readers can see JSON and Gson used in some real-world situations.
To download these examples, follow the instructions
[here](http.rst#complete-examples).

In addition to the examples listed in the HTTP reading, the following
examples are specific to this JSON reading:

| Name                             | Description                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cs1302.web/cs1302.web.Example4` | Create a JSON-formatted string by hand, then parse it into a Java object using using Google's Gson library. |

To run an example, use the provided `compile.sh` script along with the
name of the example:

```
$ ./compile.sh cs1302.web/cs1302.web.Example4
```

## Adding Gson to a Maven Project

To use Gson in a Maven project, Gson must be added as a dependency in
the project's `pom.xml` file — refer to the
[Dependency Management](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#dependency-management)
section in Maven's documentation for more information:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
  <version>2.10.1</version>
</dependency>
```

The latest version of Gson available on Maven Central is:

![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.code.gson/gson).

Once added as a dependency, Gson will automatically be available on the
classpath. For example, you could include the following near the top a
class to make a `Gson` object available within that class — the code
will compile using `mvn compile` so long as the Gson dependency is added
to the `pom.xml` file correctly:

```java
private static Gson GSON = new GsonBuilder()
    .setPrettyPrinting()
    .create();
```
