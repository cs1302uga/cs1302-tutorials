Quick Introduction to JSON
**************************

.. |GSON| replace:: Gson
.. _GSON: https://github.com/google/gson

.. |JSON| replace:: JSON
.. _JSON: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation", a text format for storing data in
strings based on the JavaScript programming language. You do not need to know
JavaScript to use JSON — the two are completely independent, and many libraries
exist in various programming languages to let us work with the format instead
of writing it by hand. Here is a small example of a JSON-formatted string
constructed by hand using Java code:

.. code-block:: java

   String nl = "\n";
   String jsonString = "{     " + nl
       + "  \"name\": \"Jay\"," + nl
       + "  \"age\": \"19\",  " + nl
       + "  \"classes\": [    " + nl
       + "    \"CSCI 1302\",  " + nl
       + "    \"CSCI 1730\"   " + nl
       + "  ]                 " + nl
       + "}                   ";
   System.out.println(jsonString);

Here is the output for that example — once printed, the JSON-formatted
string looks really nice:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "Jay",
     "age": "19",
     "classes": [
       "CSCI 1302",
       "CSCI 1730",
       "CSCI 2610"
     ]
   }

In a JSON-formatted string,

* ``""`` is used to denote a *key* or literal *value*;
* ``{}`` is used to denote an *object*; and
* ``[]`` is used to denote an array.

With that in mind, let's consider a Java class that might
organize its instance data in a similar to way to the
object described by the JSON-formatted string from earlier:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Student {
       String name;
       int age;
       String[] classes;
   } // Student

.. |Gson_fromJson| replace:: fromJson
.. _Gson_fromJson: https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html

Now that we have a Java class to represent the same kind
of information, we can use Google's |GSON|_ library to
parse the JSON-formatted string directly into a ``Student``
object using the |Gson_fromJson|_ method. The example below
assumes that Gson is added as a project dependency and that a
``Gson`` object is available via ``GSON`` — instructions
describing how to add Gson to a Maven project are included
later in this reading:

.. code-block:: java

   // parse JSON-formatted string into a Student object
   Student jay = GSON.fromJson(jsonString, Example4.Student.class);

   // inspect the result
   System.out.println(jay.name);
   System.out.println(jay.age);
   System.out.println("Classes:");
   for (int i = 0; i < jay.classes.length; i++) {
       String className = jay.classes[i];
       System.out.println(" - " + className);
   } // for

Here is the expected output:

.. code-block::

   Jay
   19
   Classes:
    - CSCI 1302
    - CSCI 1730
    - CSCI 2610

Complete Examples
*****************

Several complete and working code examples accompany this reading so
that readers can see JSON and Gson used in some real-world
situations. To download these examples, follow the instructions
`here <http.rst#complete-examples>`__.

In addition to the examples listed in the HTTP reading, the following
examples are specific to this JSON reading:

.. |ex4| replace:: ``cs1302.web/cs1302.web.Example4``
.. _ex4: src/main/java/cs1302/web/Example4.java

=======  ================================================================================
Name     Description
=======  ================================================================================
|ex4|_   Create a JSON-formatted string by hand, then parse it into a Java object using
         using Google's Gson library.
=======  ================================================================================

To run an example, use the provided ``compile.sh`` script along with the
name of the example:

.. code-block::

   $ ./compile.sh cs1302.web/cs1302.web.Example4

Adding Gson to a Maven Project
******************************

.. |maven_add_deps| replace:: Importing Dependencies
.. _maven_add_deps: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies

To use Gson in a Maven project, Gson must be added as a dependency
in the project's ``pom.xml`` file — refer to the |maven_add_deps|_
page in Maven's documentation for more information:

.. code-block:: xml

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
     <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
     <version>2.9.0</version>
   </dependency>

Once added as a dependency, Gson will automatically be available
on the classpath. For example, you could include the following
near the top a class to make a ``Gson`` object available within
that class — the code will compile using ``mvn compile`` so
long as the Gson dependency is added to the ``pom.xml`` file correctly:

.. code-block:: java

   private static Gson GSON = new GsonBuilder()
       .setPrettyPrinting()
       .create();
